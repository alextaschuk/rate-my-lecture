# Rate My Lecture
#### Currently a work in progress!
****
Rate My Lecture (RML) is a Next.js app in which students who are attending The University of British Columbia's Vancouver or Okanagan campuses can leave reviews on the content of the courses they have taken. Reviews may include information such as:
- How interesting the course's overall content was
- The extent to which the content was helpful towards the user's degree
- Class size, engagement, and participation 
- Workload
- Whether there is a large selection of time slots for flexible scheduling
- Content pacing (i.e., a lot of content covered superficially, a short amount of content covered in-depth, etc.)
